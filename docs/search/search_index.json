Moore in 1968 at the United States National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), to help control radio telescopes. Today it is used in numerous spacecraft, such as the Rosetta/Philae probe which uses 10 RTX2010 processors that support direct execution of Forth. NASA has a list of space-related applications of the Forth, compiled by James Rash, at Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland. Forth is generally targeted at small embedded systems and microcontrollers like the STM8 used in various consumer devices like chinese gadgets. What catches my attention in Forth is the possibility of being used running directly on the microcontroller using a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) programming environment that allows the programmer to interact with a running program, experiment and obtain immediate results directly in the microcontroller, without the need for cross-compilation, which reduces development time. Other features are also useful, such as the ease of the interface and, because it is relatively simple, it is easy to deploy and optimize for a specific architecture.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/#moving-forth-a-series-on-writing-forth-kernels","title":"Moving Forth: a series on writing Forth kernels","text":"<p>This series originally appeared in The Computer Journal.

CamelForth uses the 8051 registers as follows:</p> <p> Figure 1. 8051 register usage</p> <p></p> <p>The registers labelled \u201cscratch\u201d may be used within Forth words, but have no guaranteed value between Forth words (except that the register select bits in PSW must always be 00 in 8051 CamelForth).</p> <p>The 8051 stack pointer SP points to the last byte actually stored in the Return stack. This stack grows from internal RAM location (register) 09 upward to 7F.</p> <p>In CamelForth, each task\u2019s private data is contained within a 768-byte \u201ctask area,\u201d organized as in Figure 2.</p> <p> Figure 2. CamelForth task area</p> <p></p> <p>All of this data is addressed relative to a pointer, UAREA, whose high byte is stored in register 8. (The Task Area is page-aligned, so the low byte of this pointer is always 00.) To make another Task Area current, only this pointer need be changed. Note that the start of the Task Area is 100h bytes before UAREA.</p> <p>So, to switch the from one task\u2019s context to another, the following steps must be taken:</p> <ol> <li>Save the \u201cimportant\u201d registers and the Return stack in external RAM, with the task\u2019s private data. This is is purpose of the \u201cTask Save Area\u201d in Figure 2.</li> <li>Switch the UAREA pointer to the new task\u2019s User Variables area.</li> <li>Restore the previously-saved registers and Return stack from the new task\u2019s Task Save Area.</li> <li>Resume execution.</li> </ol> <p>The code to do this is shown in Listing 1, as a Forth word SWITCH. This word expects the address of the new task\u2019s Task Save Area on top of stack (i.e., in DPTR). Obviously, copying the Return stack out to the Task Save Area is the time-consuming step, so SWITCH includes a tight loop to copy registers N to 1 to external RAM, using R0 as the loop counter. The number of the highest register to be saved is contained in the Return stack pointer SP; this number is saved in the first byte of the Task Save Area.</p> <p>Since SWITCH is called as a subroutine, the program counter will already be pushed on the return stack (and thus saved by the copy loop). Register R0 (the Data stack pointer) is saved by copying it to R1 before the loop. DPTR doesn\u2019t need to be saved, since its contents can be discarded after the task is switched. On the other hand, R2-R5 are saved needlessly, since they don\u2019t need to be preserved across Forth words. But including them simplifies the loop, and will come in handy later.</p> <p>After SWITCH copies the current task\u2019s context out to RAM, it fetches the new task\u2019s context (specified by the address parameter passed to SWITCH). The process is simply the reverse of what was done to save the context. This assumes that the new Task Save Area contains the data saved when that task did a SWITCH. What about a brand-new task?</p> <p>The Forth word INITTASK sets up the Task Save Area for a new task. It saves 10 bytes in the Task Save Area: two bytes of return stack, and the eight registers 1 through 8. For register 8, the high byte of the User Variables area address is stored. For register 1, the low byte of the Parameter stack pointer, 0FD, is stored (this value will cause an empty stack once the task starts running). The \u201csaved\u201d return stack contains only a return address, which is where execution will begin when the task is started.</p> <p>So, to create and launch a new task:</p> <ol> <li>Reserve 768 bytes of storage for the Task Area. Call this area <code>taskname</code>. This name can be defined as a Forth CONSTANT, or by using CREATE if care is taken to keep the area page-aligned.</li> <li>Initialize the task to perform a Forth <code>word</code>, with the command <code>\u2018 word taskname INITTASK</code></li> <li>Launch the new task with the command <code>taskname SWITCH</code></li> </ol> <p>The \u201cmain\u201d CamelForth task will be suspended, and the new task will run. Beware: if the new task never does a SWITCH back to the main task, it will retain control forever!</p> <p>Listing 2 shows an example of how to define a task area in high RAM, by offsetting it below the main task\u2019s user area (thus ensuring page alignment). It also shows how to write a task that will do something and then return to the main task: after loading this program, every time you type <code>TASK1 SWITCH</code>, the 8051 will emit a bell character.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/8051task/#round-robin-task-switching","title":"ROUND-ROBIN TASK SWITCHING","text":"<p>For true multitasking, each task must run for a short time, and then hand off control to another task...making sure that all of the defined tasks get a turn. One way to do this is to have each task switch to the \u201cnext\u201d task in the list. This can be done, clumsily, with SWITCH statements, as long as the list never changes (since task addresses are hard-coded in the program). A better way is to maintain a dynamic linked list of all tasks in RAM.</p> <p>Listing 3 shows high-level words to manage a linked list of tasks. The first cell of the user variables (at offset 0 from UAREA) is reserved in CamelForth for a task link. MYTASK always returns the address of the running task area, by offseting -100h from UAREA. DETACH empties the task list, by making the running task link back to itself. (This causes an inadvertent PAUSE to simply save and restore to the running task\u2019s context.) ATTACH adds a task to the list, inserting it immediately after the running task. Finally, PAUSE just causes a switch to the next task in the list. The secret to PAUSE is that it fetches a User variable, TASKLINK. User variables are always addressed relative to the current UAREA pointer, so whenever a task runs PAUSE, it fetches its link to the \u201cnext\u201d task. In this manner, all of the tasks are linked together in a circular list. (See Figure 3.)</p> <p> Figure 3. Linked list of two tasks</p> <p></p> <p>Listing 3 also includes the \u201cbell\u201d demo, this time written with PAUSE. Every time PAUSE is typed at the keyboard, a bell character is output.</p> <p>SWITCH can also be used to implement more complex task schedulers, by defining a \u201cdispatcher\u201d task (or a \u201cdispatcher\u201d Forth word). The dispatcher might, for example, select the task having highest-priority according to some rule. This is left as an exercise for the student.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/8051task/#pre-emptive-task-switching","title":"PRE-EMPTIVE TASK SWITCHING","text":"<p>SWITCH and PAUSE require a task to voluntarily give up the CPU to other tasks. This \u201ccooperative\u201d multitasking is simple and efficient, and avoids many of the synchronization problems that can occur when many tasks share a resource. But poorly written tasks can \u201chog\u201d the CPU, and with even the best-written tasks, it\u2019s difficult to parcel out CPU time evenly.</p> <p>A preemptive multitasker uses some external event -- typically a timer interrupt -- to force a task switch. This ensures that tasks are switched regularly. But since a task switch can occur at any time -- not just between Forth words -- we must take pains to save all of the working registers that are used by CamelForth.</p> <p>SWITCH saves all of the working registers except R1-R3, DPH, DPL, ACC, B, and PSW. The simplest solution is for the interrupt to push these onto the return stack, and then call SWITCH with the address of the next task. When the round-robin returns to this task, SWITCH will return to the interrupt service routine, which will then pop these eight registers and return to wherever this task was suspended. A subroutine PREEMPT to do this is given in Listing 4.</p> <p>Note that PREEMPT fetches the same task link as does PAUSE. We can\u2019t use <code>ACALL PAUSE</code>, since the phrase <code>TASKLINK @</code> in PAUSE may destroy some registers that we haven\u2019t saved. (We could learn this by examining the kernel listing for USER and @, but it\u2019s bad form to build such hidden dependencies into kernel words.)</p> <p>Also, PREEMPT saves all of the \u201cextra\u201d registers on the Return stack, except DPH and DPL. This is because SWITCH, before returning to PREEMPT, pops DPH and DPL from the Data stack.</p> <p>Listing 4 also shows how to link PREEMPT to a timer interrupt, and initialize the timer. Listing 5 is the corresponding high-level test code. Once TASK1 is ATTACHed, the variable TICKS should increment every 65.536 msec (with a 12 MHz oscillator), and yet there should be no visible effect on normal Forth operation. Note the use of PAUSE to return control immediately to the \u201cmain\u201d task, after the interrupt is processed.</p> <p>A disadvantage of this approach is that the RETI instruction, required by the 8051\u2019s interrupt processing hardware, is not executed until the preempted task is resumed. For a simple example this is tolerable. To avoid this problem, PREEMPT should call a second copy of SWITCH, identical except that it ends with a RETI. Then PREEMPT should end with a RET.</p> <p>Also, the preemptive multitasker could be made slightly more efficient if SWITCH saved all working registers (i.e., if PREEMPT were merged into the SWITCH routine). But this adds unnecessary overhead to the \u201ccooperative\u201d SWITCH. The code presented here clearly shows the extra context-switching overhead of a preemptive multitasker.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/8051task/#listing-1","title":"LISTING 1","text":"<pre><code>;   ===============================================\n;   CamelForth Multitasker for the Intel 8051\n;   (c) 1996 Bradford J.

But like many \"easy\" and \"obvious\" tasks, not much is written on how to do it! So, when Bill Kibler suggested this topic for an article, I decided to break with the great oral tradition of Forthwrights, and document the process in black and white. Over the course of these articles I will develop Forths for the 6809, 8051, and Z80. I'm doing the 6809 to illustrate an easy and conventional Forth model; plus, I've already published a 6809 assembler [ROD91] [ROD92], and I'll be needing a 6809 Forth for future TCJ projects. I'm doing the 8051 Forth for a University project, but it also illustrates some rather different design decisions. The Z80 Forth is for all the CP/M readers of TCJ, and for some friends with TRS-80s gathering dust.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving1/#the-essential-hardware","title":"THE ESSENTIAL HARDWARE","text":"<p>You must choose a CPU. I will not delve into the merits of one CPU over another for Forth, since a CPU choice is usually forced upon you by other considerations. Besides, the object of this article is to show how to move Forth to any CPU.</p> <p>You can expect the usual 16-bit Forth kernel (see below) to occupy about 8 kBytes of program space. For a full kernel that can compile Forth definitions, you should allow a minimum of 1 kByte of RAM.

Indirect Threaded Code</p> <p></p> <p>Assume SQUARE is encountered while executing some other Forth word. Forth's Interpreter Pointer (IP) will be pointing to a cell in memory -- contained within that \"other\" word -- which contains the address of the word SQUARE. (To be precise, that cell contains the address of SQUARE's Code Field .) The interpreter fetches that address, and then uses it to fetch the contents of SQUARE's Code Field. These contents are yet another address -- the address of a machine language subroutine which performs the word SQUARE. In pseudo-code, this is:</p> <p>NEXT (interpreter)</p>     (IP) -&gt; W        fetch memory pointed by IP into \"W\" register  ... W now holds address of the Code Field     IP+2 -&gt; IP        advance IP, just like a program counter  (assuming 2-byte addresses in the thread)         (W) -&gt; X        fetch memory pointed by W into \"X\" register  ... X now holds address of the machine code         JP (X)        jump to the address in the X register     <p>This illustrates an important but rarely-elucidated principle: the address of the Forth word just entered is kept in W. CODE words don't need this information, but all other kinds of Forth words do.</p> <p>If SQUARE were written in machine code, this would be the end of the story: that bit of machine code would be executed, and then jump back to the Forth interpreter -- which, since IP was incremented, is pointing to the next word to be executed. This is why the Forth interpreter is usually called NEXT.</p> <p>But, SQUARE is a high-level \"colon\" definition -- it holds a \"thread\", a list of addresses. In order to perform this definition, the Forth interpreter must be re-started at a new location: the Parameter Field of SQUARE. Of course, the interpreter's old location must be saved, to resume the \"other\" Forth word once SQUARE is finished. This is just like a subroutine call! The machine language action of SQUARE is simply to push the old IP, set IP to a new location, run the interpreter, and when SQUARE is done pop the IP. (As you can see, the IP is the \"program counter\" of high-level Forth.) This is called DOCOLON or ENTER in various Forths:</p> <p>ENTER</p>     PUSH IP        onto the \"return address stack\"         W+2 -&gt; IP        W still points to the Code Field, so W+2 is the address of the Body!

Colon definitions compile one cell for each word used in the definition. And the Forth interpreter must actually perform a double indirection to get the address of the next machine code to run (first through IP, then through W).</p> <p>ITC is neither the smallest nor the fastest threading technique. It may be the simplest; although DTC (described next) is really no more complex. So why are so many Forths indirect-threaded? Mainly because previous Forths, used as models, were indirect-threaded. These days, DTC is becoming more popular.</p> <p>So when should ITC be used? Of the various techniques, ITC produces the cleanest and most elegant definitions -- nothing but addresses. If you're attuned to such considerations, ITC may appeal to you. If your code fiddles around with the insides of definitions, the simplicity and uniformity of the ITC representation may enhance portability.

Fortunately, you can get quite a good \"feel\" with just a small subset of the Forth kernel.</p> <p>Guy Kelly [KEL92] examines the following code samples for 19 different IBM PC Forths:</p> <p>NEXT ...the \"inner interpreter\" that chains from one Forth word to another in the \"thread\". This is used at the end of every CODE definition, and is one of the most important factors in speed of Forth execution. You've already seen the pseudo-code for this in ITC and DTC; in STC it's just CALL/RETURN.</p> <p>ENTER ...also called DOCOL or DOCOLON; the Code Field action that causes a high level \"colon\" definition to be executed. This, too, is crucial for speed; it is used at the start of every colon definition. Not needed in STC.</p> <p>EXIT ...called ;S in fig-Forth; the code that ends the execution of a colon definition. This is essentially the high-level subroutine return, and appears at the end of every colon definition. This is just a machine code RETURN in STC.</p> <p>NEXT, ENTER, and EXIT indicate the performance of the threading mechanism. These should be coded to evaluate ITC vs. DTC vs. STC. They also reflect the quality of your register assignments for IP, W, and RSP.</p> <p>DOVAR ...a.k.a. \"variable\"; the machine code fragment that is the Code Field action for all Forth VARIABLEs.</p> <p>DOCON ...a.k.a. \"constant\"; the machine code fragment that is the Code Field action for all Forth CONSTANTs.</p> <p>DOCON and DOVAR, along with ENTER, show how efficiently you can obtain the Parameter Field address of a word being executed. This reflects your choice for the W register. In a DTC Forth, this also indicates whether to put a JUMP or CALL in the Code Field.</p> <p>LIT ...a.k.a. \"literal\"; is a Forth word that fetches a cell value from the high-level thread. Several words use such in-line parameters, and this is a good indicator of their performance. It reflects your choice for the IP register.</p> <p>@ ...the Forth memory-fetch operator, shows how quickly memory can be accessed from high-level Forth. This word usually benefits from TOS in stack.</p> <p>! ...the Forth memory-store operator, is another indicator of memory access. This consumes two items from the stack, and illustrates efficiency of Parameter Stack access. It's a good indicator of the TOS-in-memory vs. TOS-in-register tradeoff.</p> <p>+ ...the addition operator, is a representative example of all the Forth arithmetic and logical operators. Like the ! word, this benchmarks stack access, and it's a clear demonstration of any TOS-in-register benefit.</p> <p>This is an excellent set of code samples. I have a few additional favorites:</p> <p>DODOES ...is the Code Field action for words built with DOES&gt;. This doesn't yield any new benchmark comparisons, although it does reflect the usefulness of W, IP, and RSP. I include it because it's the most convoluted code in the Forth kernel. If you can code the logic of DODOES, everything else is a snap. The intricacies of DODOES will be described in a subsequent article.</p> <p>SWAP ...a simple stack operator, but still educational.</p> <p>OVER ...a more complex stack operator. This gives a good idea of how easily you can access the Parameter Stack.</p> <p>ROT ...a still more complex stack operator, and the one most likely to need an extra temporary register. If you can code ROT without needing an \"X\" register, you probably don't need an \"X\" register for anything.</p> <p>0= ...one of the few unary arithmetic operators, and one of the most likely to benefit from TOS-in-register.</p> <p>+! ...a most illustrative operator, combining stack access, arithmetic, memory fetch and store. This is one of my favorite benchmarks, although it is less frequently used than the other words in this list.</p> <p>These are among the most-used words in the Forth kernel. It pays to optimize them. I'll show examples of all of these, including pseudo-code, for the 6809. For the other CPUs, I'll use selected examples to illustrate specific decisions.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving2/#case-study-1-the-6809","title":"CASE STUDY 1: THE 6809","text":"<p>In the world of 8-bit CPUs, the 6809 is the Forth programmer's dream machine. It supports two stacks! It also has two other address registers, and a wealth of orthogonal addressing modes second only to the PDP-11. (\"Orthogonal\" means they work the same way and have the same options for all address registers.) The two 8-bit accumulators can be treated as a single 16-bit accumulator, and there are many 16-bit operations.</p> <p>The programmer's model of the 6809 is [MOT83]:</p> <p>A - 8 bit accumulator B - 8 bit accumulator</p> <p>Most arithmetic operations use an accumulator as the destination. These can be concatenated and treated as a single 16-bit accumulator D (A high byte, B low).</p> <p>X - 16 bit index register Y - 16 bit index register S - 16 bit stack pointer U - 16 bit stack pointer</p> <p>All addressing modes for X and Y can also be used with the S and U registers.</p> <p>PC - 16 bit program counter CC - 8 bit Condition Code register DP - 8 bit Direct Page register</p> <p>The 6800 family's Direct addressing mode uses an 8-bit address to reach any location in memory page zero. The 6809 allows any page to be Direct-addressed; this register provides the high 8 bits of address.</p> <p>Those two stack pointers are crying out for Forth use. They are equivalent, except that S is used for subroutine calls and interrupts. Let's be consistent and use S for return addresses, leaving U for the Parameter Stack.</p> <p>W and IP both need to be address registers, so these are the logical use for X and Y. X and Y are equivalent, so let's arbitrarily assign X=W, and Y=IP.</p> <p>Now a threading model can be chosen. I'll scratch STC and TTC, to make this a \"conventional\" Forth. The limiting factor in performance is then the NEXT routine. Let's look at this in both ITC and DTC:</p> <pre><code>ITC-NEXT: LDX ,Y++   (8) (IP)-&gt;W, increment IP\n          JMP [,X]   (6) (W)-&gt;temp, jump to adrs in temp\n\nDTC-NEXT: JMP [,Y++] (9) (IP)-&gt;temp, increment IP,\n                         jump to adrs in temp\n                         (\"temp\" is internal to the 6809)\n</code></pre> <p>NEXT is one instruction in a DTC 6809! This means you can code it in-line in two bytes, making it both smaller and faster than JMP NEXT. For comparison, look at the \"NEXT\" logic for subroutine threading:</p> <pre><code>        RTS           (5) ...at the end of one CODE word \n        JSR nextword  (8) ...in the \"thread\"\n        ...               ...start of the next CODE word\n</code></pre> <p>STC takes 13 clocks to thread to the next word, compared with 9 clocks for DTC. This is because subroutine threading has to pop and push a return address, while simple DTC or ITC threading between CODE words does not.</p> <p>Given the choice of DTC, you have to decide: does a high-level word have a Jump or Call in its Code Field? The driving consideration is how quickly can you obtain the address of the parameter field which follows? Let's look at the code to ENTER a colon definition, using symbolic Forth register names, to see this illustrated:</p> <p>using a JSR (Call):</p> <pre><code>        JSR ENTER   (8)\n        ...\nENTER:  PULS W      (7) get address following JSR into W reg\n        PSHS IP     (7) save the old IP on the Return Stack\n        TFR  W,IP   (6) Parameter Field address -&gt; IP\n        NEXT        (9) assembler macro for JMP [,Y++] \n                    37 cycles total\n</code></pre> <p>using a JMP:</p> <pre><code>        JMP ENTER   (4)\n         ...\nENTER:  PSHS IP     (7) save the old IP on the Return Stack\n        LDX -2,IP   (6) re-fetch the Code Field address\n        LEAY 3,X    (5) add 3 and put into IP (Y) register\n        NEXT        (9)\n                    31 cycles total\n\n                    (CPU cycle counts are in parentheses.)\n</code></pre> <p>The DTC 6809 NEXT doesn't use the W register, because the 6809 addressing modes allow an extra level of indirection automatically. The JMP version of ENTER has to re-fetch the Code Field address -- NEXT didn't leave it in any register -- and then add 3 to get the Parameter Field address. The JSR version can get the Parameter Field address directly by popping the return stack. Even so, the JMP version is faster. (Exercise for the student: try coding the JSR ENTER with S=PSP and U=RSP.)</p> <p>Either way, the code for EXIT is the same:</p> <pre><code>EXIT:   PULS IP     pop \"saved\" IP from return stack\n        NEXT        continue Forth interpretation\n</code></pre> <p>Some registers remain to allocate. You could keep the User Pointer in memory, and this Forth would still be pretty fast. But the DP register would go to waste, and there's not much else it can do. Let's use the \"trick\" described above, and hold the high byte of UP in the DP register. (The low byte of UP is implied to be zero.)</p> <p>One 16-bit register is left: D. Most arithmetic operations need this register. Should it be left free as a scratch register, or used as the Top-Of-Stack? 6809 instructions use memory as one operand, so a second working register may be unnecessary. And if a scratch register is needed, it's easy to push and pop D. Let's write the benchmark primitives both ways, and see which is faster.</p> <p>NEXT, ENTER, and EXIT don't use the stack, and thus have identical code either way.</p> <p>DOVAR, DOCON, LIT, and OVER require the same number of CPU cycles either way. These illustrate the earlier comment that putting TOS in register often just changes where the push or pop takes place:</p> <pre><code>        TOS in D        TOS in memory   pseudo-code\n        -------------   -------------   ---------------------\n\nDOVAR:  PSHU TOS        LDD  -2,IP      address of CF -&gt; D\n        LDD  -2,IP      ADDD #3         address of PF -&gt; D\n        ADDD #3         PSHU D          push D onto stack\n        NEXT            NEXT\n\nDOCON:  PSHU TOS        LDX  -2,IP      address of CF -&gt; W\n        LDX  -2,IP      LDD  3,X        contents of PF -&gt; D\n        LDD  3,X        PSHU D          push D onto stack\n        NEXT            NEXT\n\nLIT:    PSHU TOS        LDD  ,IP++      (IP) -&gt; D, increment IP\n        LDD  ,IP++      PSHU D          push D onto stack\n        NEXT            NEXT\n\nOVER:   PSHU D          LDD  2,PSP      2nd on stack -&gt; D\n        LDD  2,PSP      PSHU D          push D onto stack\n        NEXT            NEXT\n</code></pre> <p>SWAP, ROT, 0=, @, and especially + are all faster with TOS in register:</p> <pre><code>        TOS in D        TOS in memory   pseudo-code\n        ------------    -------------   ----------------\n\nSWAP:   LDX  ,PSP (5)   LDD  ,PSP (5)   TOS -&gt; D\n        STD  ,PSP (5)   LDX 2,PSP (6)   2nd on stack -&gt; X\n        TFR  X,D  (6)   STD 2,PSP (6)   D -&gt; 2nd on stack\n        NEXT            STX  ,PSP (5)   X -&gt; TOS\n                        NEXT\n\nROT:    LDX  ,PSP (5)   LDX  ,PSP (5)   TOS -&gt; X\n        STD  ,PSP (5)   LDD 2,PSP (6)   2nd on stack -&gt; D\n        LDD 2,PSP (6)   STX 2,PSP (6)   X -&gt; 2nd on stack\n        STX 2,PSP (6)   LDX 4,PSP (6)   3rd on stack -&gt; X\n        NEXT            STD 4,PSP (6)   D -&gt; 3rd on stack\n                        STX  ,PSP (5)   X -&gt; TOS\n                        NEXT \n\n0=:     CMPD #0         LDD  ,PSP       TOS -&gt; D\n        BEQ  TRUE       CMPD #0         does D equal zero?\n                        BEQ  TRUE\n  FALSE:LDD  #0         LDD  #0         no...put 0 in TOS\n        NEXT            STD  ,PSP\n                        NEXT\n  TRUE: LDD  #-1        LDD  #-1        yes...put -1 in TOS\n        NEXT            STD  ,PSP\n                        NEXT  \n\n@:      TFR TOS,W (6)   LDD [,PSP] (8)  fetch D using TOS adrs\n        LDD  ,W   (5)   STD  ,PSP  (5)  D -&gt; TOS\n        NEXT            NEXT\n\n+:      ADDD ,U++       PULU D          pop TOS into D\n        NEXT            ADDD ,PSP       add new TOS into D\n                        STD  ,PSP       store D into TOS\n                        NEXT\n</code></pre> <p>! and +! are slower with TOS in register:</p> <pre><code>        TOS in D        TOS in memory   pseudo-code\n        ------------    ------------    -----------------\n\n!:      TFR TOS,W (6)   PULU W   (7)    pop adrs into W\n        PULU D    (7)   PULU D   (7)    pop data into D\n        STD  ,W   (5)   STD  ,W  (5)    store data to adrs\n        PULU TOS  (7)   NEXT\n        NEXT\n\n+!:     TFR TOS,W (6)   PULU W   (7)    pop adrs into W\n        PULU TOS  (7)   PULU D   (7)    pop data into D\n        ADDD ,W   (6)   ADDD ,W  (6)    add memory into D\n        STD  ,W   (5)   STD  ,W  (5)    store D to memory\n        PULU TOS  (7)   NEXT\n        NEXT\n</code></pre> <p>The reason these words are slower is that most Forth memory-reference words expect the address on the top of stack, so an extra TFR instruction is needed.

It has only one general-purpose address register, and one addressing mode, which always uses the one 8-bit accumulator.</p> <p>All of the arithmetic operations, and many of the logical, must use the accumulator. The only 16-bit operation is INC DPTR. The hardware stack must use the 128-byte on-chip register file. [SIG92] Such a CPU could give ulcers.</p> <p>Some 8051 Forths have been written that implement a full 16-bit model, e.g. [PAY90], but they are too slow for my taste. Let's make some tradeoffs and make a faster 8051 Forth.</p> <p>Our foremost reality is the availability of only one address register. So let's use the 8051's Program Counter as IP -- i.e., let's make a subroutine-threaded Forth. If the compiler uses 2-byte ACALLs instead of 3-byte LCALLs whenever possible, most of the STC code will be as small as ITC or DTC code.</p> <p>Subroutine threading implies that the Return Stack Pointer is the hardware stack pointer. There are 64 cells of space in the on-chip register file, not enough room for multiple task stacks. At this point you can</p> <p>a) restrict this Forth to single-task; b) code all of the Forth definitions so that upon entry they move their return address to a software stack in external RAM; or c) do task switches by swapping the entire Return Stack to and from external RAM.</p> <p>Option (b) is slow! Moving 128 bytes on every task switch is faster than moving 2 bytes on every Forth word. For now I choose option (a), leaving the door open for (c) at some future date.</p> <p>The one-and-only \"real\" address register, DPTR, will have to do multiple duty. It becomes W, the multi-purpose working register.</p> <p>In truth, there are two other registers that can address external memory: R0 and R1. They provide only an 8-bit address; the high 8 bits are explicitly output on port 2. But this is a tolerable restriction for stacks, since they can be limited to a 256-byte space. So let's use R0 as the PSP.</p> <p>This same 256-byte space can be used for user data.

It has four different kinds of address registers! Some operations use A as destination, some any 8-bit register, some HL, some any 16-bit register, and so on. Many operations (such as EX DE,HL) are only defined for one combination of registers.</p> <p>In a CPU such as the Z80 (or 8086!), the assignment of Forth functions must be carefully matched to the capabilities of the CPU registers. Many more tradeoffs need to be evaluated, and often the only way is to write sample code for a number of different assignments. Rather than burden this article down endless permutations of Forth code, I'll present one register assignment based on many Z80 code experiments. It turns out that these choices can be rationalized in terms of the general principles outlined earlier.</p> <p>I want a \"conventional\" Forth, although I will use direct threading. All of the \"classical\" virtual registers will be needed.</p> <p>Ignoring the alternate register set, the Z80 has six address registers, with the following capabilities:</p> <pre><code>BC,DE - LD A indirect, INC, DEC\n        also exchange DE/HL\n\n    HL - LD r indirect, ALU indirect, INC, DEC, ADD, ADC, \n        SBC, exchange w/TOS, JP indirect\n\nIX,IY - LD r indexed, ALU indexed, INC, DEC, ADD, ADC,\n        SBC, exchange w/TOS, JP indirect  (all slow)\n\n    SP - PUSH/POP 16-bit, ADD/ADC/SUB to HL/IX/IY\n</code></pre> <p>BC, DE, and HL can also be manipulated in 8-bit pieces.</p> <p>The 8-bit register A must be left as a scratch register, since it's the destination for so many ALU and memory reference operations.</p> <p>HL is undoubtedly the most versatile register, and at one time or another it is tempting to use it for each of the Forth virtual registers. However, because of its versatility -- and because it is the only register which can be fetched byte-wise and used in an indirect jump -- HL should be used for W, Forth's all-purpose working register.</p> <p>IX and IY might be considered for the Forth stack pointers, because of their indexed addressing mode, which can be used in ALU operations. But there are two problems with this: it leaves SP without a job; and, IX/IY are too slow! Most of the operations on either stack involve pushing or popping 16-bit quantities. This is one instruction using SP, but it requires four using IX or IY. One of the Forth stacks should use SP. And this should be the Parameter Stack, since it is used more heavily than the Return Stack.</p> <p>What about Forth's IP? Mostly, IP fetches from memory and autoincrements, so there's no programming advantage to using IX/IY over BC/DE. But speed is of the essence with IP, and BC/DE are faster. Let's put IP in DE: it has the advantage of being able to swap with HL, which adds versatility.</p> <p>A second Z80 register pair (other than W) will be needed for 16-bit arithmetic. Only BC is left, and it can be used for addressing or for ALU operations with A. But should BC be a second working register \"X\", or the top-of-stack? Only code will tell; for now, let's optimistically assume that BC=TOS.</p> <p>This leaves the RSP and UP functions, and the IX and IY registers unused. IX and IY are equivalent, so let's assign IX=RSP, and IY=UP.</p> <p>Thus the Z80 Forth register assignments are:</p> <pre><code>BC = TOS   IX = RSP\nDE = IP    IY = UP\nHL = W     SP = PSP\n</code></pre> <p>Now look at NEXT for the DTC Forth:</p> <pre><code>DTC-NEXT: LD A,(DE) (7) (IP)-&gt;W, increment IP\n          LD L,A    (4)\n          INC DE    (6)\n          LD A,(DE) (7)\n          LD H,A    (4)\n          INC DE    (6)\n          JP (HL)   (4) jump to address in W\n</code></pre> <p>alternate version (same number of clock cycles)</p> <pre><code>DTC-NEXT: EX DE,HL  (4) (IP)-&gt;W, increment IP\nNEXT-HL:  LD E,(HL) (7)\n          INC HL    (6)\n          LD D,(HL) (7)\n          INC HL    (6)\n          EX DE,HL  (4)\n          JP (HL)   (4) jump to address in W\n</code></pre> <p>Note that cells are stored low-byte first in memory. Also, although it might seem advantageous to keep IP in HL, it really isn't. This is because the Z80 can't JP (DE). The NEXT-HL entry point will be used shortly.</p> <p>Just for comparison, let's look at an ITC NEXT. The pseudo-code given previously requires another temporary register \"X\", whose contents can be used for an indirect jump. Let DE=X, and BC=IP. TOS will have to be kept in memory.</p> <pre><code>ITC-NEXT: LD A,(BC) (7) (IP)-&gt;W, increment IP\n          LD L,A    (4)\n          INC BC    (6)\n          LD A,(BC) (7)\n          LD H,A    (4)\n          INC BC    (6)\n\n          LD E,(HL) (7) (W)-&gt;X\n          INC HL    (6)\n          LD D,(HL) (7)\n          EX DE,HL  (4) jump to address in X\n          JP (HL)   (4)  \n</code></pre> <p>This leaves \"W\" incremented by one, and in the DE register. As long as this is done consistently, there's no problem -- code needing the contents of W knows where to find it, and how much to adjust it.</p> <p>The ITC NEXT is 11 instructions, as compared to 7 for DTC. And ITC on the Z80 loses the ability to keep TOS in a register. My choice is DTC.</p> <p>If coded in-line, DTC NEXT would require seven bytes in every CODE word. A jump to a common NEXT routine would only use three bytes, but would add 10 clock cycles. This is another of the tradeoff decisions in designing a Forth kernel. This example is a close call; let's opt for speed with an in-line NEXT. But sometimes NEXT is so huge, or memory is so tight, that the prudent decision is to use a JMP NEXT.</p> <p>Now let's look at the code for ENTER. Using a CALL, the hardware stack is popped to get the Parameter Field address:</p> <pre><code>        CALL ENTER  (17)\n        ...\nENTER:  DEC IX      (10) push the old IP on the return stack\n        LD (IX+0),D (19)\n        DEC IX      (10)\n        LD (IX+0),E (19)\n        POP DE      (10) Parameter Field address -&gt; IP\n        NEXT        (38) assembler macro for 7 instructions\n</code></pre> <p>Actually it's faster to POP HL, and then use the last six instructions of NEXT (omitting the EX DE,HL):</p> <pre><code>        CALL ENTER  (17)\n        ...\nENTER:  DEC IX      (10) push the old IP on the return stack\n        LD (IX+0),D (19)\n        DEC IX      (10)\n        LD (IX+0),E (19)\n        POP HL      (10) Parameter Field address -&gt; HL\n        NEXT-HL     (34) see DTC NEXT code, above\n                    119 cycles total\n</code></pre> <p>When a JP is used, the W register (HL) is left pointing to the Code Field. The Parameter Field is 3 bytes after:</p> <pre><code>        JP ENTER    (10)\n        ...\nENTER:  DEC IX      (10) push the old IP on the return stack\n        LD (IX+0),D (19)\n        DEC IX      (10)\n        LD (IX+0),E (19)\n        INC HL      ( 6) Parameter Field address -&gt; IP\n        INC HL      ( 6)\n        INC HL      ( 6) \n        NEXT-HL     (34)\n                    120 cycles total\n</code></pre> <p>Again, because of the alternate entry point for NEXT, the new value for IP doesn't actually have to be put into the DE register pair.</p> <p>The CALL version is one cycle faster. On an embedded Z80, a one-byte RST instruction could be used to gain speed and save space. This option is not available on many Z80-based personal computers.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving2/#case-study-4-the-8086","title":"CASE STUDY 4: THE 8086","text":"<p>The 8086 is another instructive CPU.

It became evident when I started to code the Forth word EXECUTE.</p> <p>EXECUTE causes the execution of a single Forth word, whose address is given on the Parameter Stack. (To be precise: the compilation address, a.k.a. Code Field Address, is given on the stack.) This can be any kind of Forth word: CODE definition, colon definition, CONSTANT, VARIABLE, or defined word. This differs from the usual Forth interpretation process in that the address of the word-to-execute is given on the stack, and not taken from the \"thread\" (as pointed to by IP).</p> <p>In our direct-threaded 6809 code this can be easily coded:</p> <pre><code>EXECUTE:  TFR  TOS,W      put address of word in W\n          PULU TOS        pop new TOS\n          JMP  ,W         jump to address given in W\n</code></pre> <p>Note: this is JMP ,W and not JMP [,W], since we already have the code address of the word. We're not fetching from the high-level thread. (If TOS wasn't in register, EXECUTE could be done with simply JMP [,PSP++].) Now suppose that this EXECUTEd word is a colon definition. W will be pointing to its Code Field, which contains JMP ENTER. This does the following (described in the previous article):</p> <pre><code>          JMP ENTER\n          ...\nENTER:    PSHS IP\n          LDX  -2,IP      re-fetch the Code Field address\n          LEAY 3,X\n          NEXT\n</code></pre> <p>This is the mistake! We are not executing this word from within a thread, so IP was not pointing to a copy of its Code Field address! (Remember, the address of the word-to-EXECUTE came from the stack.) This form of ENTER will not work with EXECUTE, because there is no way to find the address of the word being executed!</p> <p>This suggests a new general rule for DTC Forths: if NEXT does NOT leave the address of the word-being-executed in a register, you MUST use a Call in the code field.</p> <p>So, the 6809 Forth is back to using a JSR in the Code Field. But to avoid the speed penalty for ENTER -- one of the most-used code fragments in Forth -- I'll complete the \"exercise for the student\" from the last article. Note what happens if you swap the registers assigned to RSP and PSP:</p> <pre><code>          with RSP=S,  with RSP=U,\n          and PSP=U   and PSP=S\n          (previous)  (new)\n\n          JSR ENTER   JSR ENTER\n          ...         ...\nENTER:    PULS W      PSHU IP     push old IP onto R stack\n          PSHS IP     PULS IP     pop new IP from JSR stack\n          TFR  W,IP   NEXT\n          NEXT\n</code></pre> <p>The new version executes in 31 cycles, the same as the JMP version I had wanted to use. The improvement is because the JSR version of ENTER must use both Forth's Return Stack, and the 6809 subroutine-return stack (\"JSR stack\"). Using two different stack pointers means we don't have to \"swap\" the top-of-stack with IP, eliminating the need for a temporary register.</p> <p>This illustrates the usual development process for a new Forth kernel: make some design decisions, write some sample code, discover a bug or a better way to do things, throw out some code, change some design decisions, rewrite some sample code, loop until satisfied. (This is the programming equivalent of a \"rip up\" PC board autorouter.)</p> <p>This teaches an important lesson: make EXECUTE one of your benchmark words!</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving3/#oops-again","title":"OOPS, AGAIN","text":"<p>Carey Bloodworth of Van Buren, AR has pointed out a minor but embarrassing mistake in my 6809 code in the previous installment.

Yet DOES&gt; is also one of Forth's most powerful features -- in many ways, it anticipated object-oriented programming. The action and power of DOES&gt; hinges upon a brilliant innovation of Forth: the Code Field.</p> <p>Recall from Part 1 that the \"body\" of a Forth definition consists of two parts: the Code Field, and the Parameter Field. You can think of these two fields in several ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Code Field is the \"action\" taken by this Forth word, and the Parameter Field is the data on which it acts.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Code Field is a subroutine call, and the Parameter Field is parameters that are included \"in-line\" after the call. (The assembly language programmer's view.)</p> </li> <li> <p>The Code Field is the single \"method\" for this \"class\" of words, and the Parameter Field contains the \"instance variables\" for this particular word. (The object-oriented programmer's view.)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Common features appear in all these views:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Code Field routine is always called with at least one argument, namely, the address of the Parameter Field for the Forth word being executed. The Parameter Field may contain any number of parameters.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are relatively few distinct actions, i.e., relatively few distinct routines referenced by the Code Field. Each of these routines is widely shared (except for CODE words, as we will see later). Recall, for example, the ENTER routine from Part 2: this common routine is used by all Forth colon definitions.</p> </li> <li> <p>The interpretation of the Parameter Field is implicitly determined by the contents of the Code Field. I.e., each Code Field routine expects the Parameter Field to contain a certain kind of data.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A typical Forth kernel will have several Code Field routines predefined.</p> Code Fieldroutine Parameter Fieldcontents ENTER a high-level \"thread\" (series of addresses) DOCON a constant value DOVAR a storage location for data DOVOC vocabulary info (varies by implementation) <p>What makes this feature powerful is that a Forth program is not limited to this set of Code Field routines (or whatever set is provided in your kernel). The programmer can define new Code Field routines, and new Parameter Fields to match. In object-oriented lingo, new \"classes\" and \"methods\" can be created (although each class has only one method). And -- like Forth words themselves -- the Code Field actions can be defined in either assembly language or high-level Forth!</p> <p>To understand the mechanism of the Code Field, and how parameters are passed, we will first look at the case of assembly-language (machine code) actions. We'll start with Indirect Threading (ITC), since it is the easiest to understand, and then see how the logic is modified in Direct-Threaded (DTC) and Subroutine-Threaded (STC) Forths. Then, we'll look at how the Code Field action can be written in high-level Forth.</p> <p>Forthwrights are somewhat inconsistent in their terminology, so I'll define my terms, using the ITC Forth word illustrated in Figure 1. The Header contains the dictionary information, and isn't involved in the execution of the Forth word. The Body is the \"working\" part of the word, and consists of the fixed-length Code Field, and the variable-length Parameter Field. For any given word, the locations of these two fields in memory are the Code Field Address (CFA) and the Parameter Field Address (PFA), respectively. The Code Field Address of a word is the address in memory where its Code Field is located. This is not to be confused with the contents of the Code Field, which, in ITC Forths, is another different address. To be specific, the contents of the Code Field is the address of a fragment of machine code somewhere else in memory. I will refer to this as the Code Address. Later, when in discussing DTC and STC Forths, I will also refer to the \"Code Field contents,\" which will include more than just the Code Address.</p> <p> Figure 1. An ITC Forth word</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving3/#machine-code-actions","title":"MACHINE-CODE ACTIONS","text":"<p>Forth CONSTANTs are probably the simplest example of a machine-code action. Let's consider some good Francophone constants</p> <pre><code>1 CONSTANT UN\n2 CONSTANT DEUX\n3 CONSTANT TROIS\n</code></pre> <p>Executing the word UN will push the value 1 onto the Forth Parameter Stack. Executing DEUX will push a 2 onto the stack, and so on. (Don't confuse Parameter Stack with Parameter Field; they are entirely separate.)</p> <p>In the Forth kernel there is a single word called CONSTANT. This is not a constant-type word itself; it is a high-level Forth definition. CONSTANT is a \"defining word\": it creates new words in the Forth dictionary. Here we create the new \"constant-type\" words UN, DEUX, and TROIS. (You may think of these as \"instances\" of the \"class\" CONSTANT.) These three words will have their Code Fields pointing to a machine code fragment that does the action of CONSTANT.</p> <p>What must this code fragment do? Figure 2 shows the memory representation of the three constants. All three words point to a common action routine. The difference in the words is entirely contained in their Parameter Fields, which, in this case, simply hold the constant values (\"instance variables\" in object lingo). So, the action of these three words should be fetch the contents of the Parameter Field, and push this onto the stack. The code understands implicitly that the parameter field contains a single-cell value.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 2. Three constants</p> <p></p> <p>To write a machine-code fragment to do this, we need to know how to find the Parameter Field Address, after the Forth interpreter jumps to the machine code. That is, how is the PFA passed to the machine-code routine? This, in turn, depends on how the Forth interpreter NEXT has been coded, which varies from implementation to implementation. To write machine-code actions, we must understand NEXT.</p> <p>The ITC NEXT was described in pseudo-code in Part 1. Here's one implementation for the 6809, using Y=IP and X=W:</p> <pre><code>NEXT:   LDX ,Y++    ; (IP) -&gt; W, and IP+2 -&gt; IP\n        JMP [,X]    ; (W) -&gt; temp, JMP (temp)\n</code></pre> <p>Suppose that we're in a high-level thread</p> <pre><code>... SWAP DEUX + ...\n</code></pre> <p>with the Interpreter Pointer (IP) pointing to the DEUX \"instruction,\" when NEXT is executed. (This would be at the very end of SWAP.) Figure 3 illustrates what happens. IP (register Y) is pointing within the high-level thread, at a memory cell that contains the address of the Forth word DEUX. To be precise, this cell contains the Code Field Address of DEUX. So, when we fetch a cell using Y, and auto increment Y, we fetch the Code Field Address of DEUX. This goes into W (register X), so W is now pointing to the Code Field. The contents of this field is the address of some machine code. We can fetch the contents of this cell and jump to the machine code with a single 6809 instruction. This leaves register X unchanged, so W is still pointing to the CFA of DEUX. This is how the Parameter Field Address is obtained, since, in this case, it is simply two bytes past the Code Field.</p> <p> Figure 3. ITC Before and After</p> <p></p> <p>So, the machine code fragment has only to add 2 to W, fetch the cell value at that address, and push that on the stack. This fragment is frequently called DOCON:</p> <pre><code>DOCON:  LDD 2,X  ; fetch the cell at W+2\n        PSHU D   ; push that on the Parameter Stack\n        NEXT     ; (macro) do the next high-level word\n</code></pre> <p>(For this example, TOS is kept in memory.) Note that the previous NEXT incremented IP by 2, so it is already pointing to the next cell in the thread (\"CFA of +\") when DOCON does NEXT.</p> <p>In general, ITC Forths leave the Parameter Field Address or some \"nearby\" address in the W register. In this case, W contained the CFA, which in this Forth implementation is always PFA-2. Since every class of Forth word except CODE words needs to use the Parameter Field Address, many implementations of NEXT will increment W to leave it pointing to the PFA. We can do this on the 6809 with one small change:</p> <pre><code>NEXT:   LDX ,Y++     ; (IP) -&gt; W, and IP+2 -&gt; IP\n        JMP [,X++]   ; (W) -&gt; temp, JMP (temp), W+2 -&gt; W\n</code></pre> <p>This adds three clock cycles to NEXT, and leaves the Parameter Field Address in W. What does it do to the Code Field routines?</p>   W=CFA  W=PFA  <pre>\nDOCON:  LDD 2,X (6)              \n        PSHU D                   \n        NEXT\nDOVAR:  LEAX 2,X (5)             \n        PSHU X                   \n        NEXT\nENTER:  PSHS Y                   \n        LEAY 2,X (5)             \n        NEXT                     \n</pre><pre>\nLDD ,X (5)                       \nPSHU D                           \nNEXT\n; no operation                   \nPSHU X                           \nNEXT\nPSHS Y                           \nLEAY ,X  (4, faster than TFR X,Y)\nNEXT                             \n</pre> <p>In exchange for a three-cycle penalty in NEXT, the DOCON code is reduced by one clock cycle, DOVAR by five cycles, and ENTER by one cycle. CODE words don't use the value in W, so they gain nothing from the auto increment. The speed gained or lost is determined by the mix of Forth words executed. The usual rule is that most of the words executed are CODE words, thus, incrementing W in NEXT costs a bit of speed overall. (There is a memory savings, but DOCON, DOVAR, and ENTER appear only once, making this gain slight.)</p> <p>The best decision, of course, depends upon the processor. On machines like the Z80, which only access memory by bytes and don't have auto increment address modes, it is often best to leave W pointing to IP+1 (the last byte fetched from the Code Field). On other machines, auto incrementing is \"free,\" and leaving W pointing to the Parameter Field is most convenient.</p> <p>Remember: the decision must be made consistently. If NEXT leaves W pointing to the PFA of the word being executed, then EXECUTE must do likewise! (This was the 'oops' that I corrected at the start of this article.)</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving3/#direct-threading","title":"Direct Threading","text":"<p>Direct Threading works just like Indirect Threading, except that instead of the Code Field containing the address of some machine code, it contains a JUMP or CALL to some machine code. This makes the Code Field larger -- e.g., 1 byte larger in the 6809 -- but removes one level of indirection from the NEXT routine.</p> <p>The choice of a JUMP or a CALL instruction in the Code Field hinges upon how the Parameter Field Address can be obtained by the machine code routine. In order to jump to the Code Field, many CPUs require that its address be in a register. For instance, the indirect jump on the 8086 is JMP AX (or some other register), and on the Z80 is JP (HL) (or IX or IY). On these processors, the DTC NEXT involves two operations, which on the 6809 would be:</p> <pre><code>NEXT:   LDX ,Y++    ; (IP) -&gt; W, and IP+2 -&gt; IP\n        JMP ,X      ; JMP (W)\n</code></pre> <p>(On the 8086, this can be done with LODSW, JMP AX.) The effect of this is illustrated in Figure 4 as \"case 1\". The Code Field Address of DEUX is fetched from the high-level thread, and IP is incremented. Then, instead of a fetch, a JUMP is made to the Code Field Address (i.e., the CPU jumps directly to the Code Field). The CFA is left in the W register, just like the first ITC example above. Since this address is already in a register, we can simply put a JUMP to DOCON in the Code Field, and the DOCON fragment will work the same as before.</p> <p> Figure 4. DTC Before and After</p> <p></p> <p>However, some processors -- such as the 6809 and PDP-11 -- can do this DTC NEXT in one instruction:</p> <pre><code>NEXT:  JMP [,Y++]   ; (IP) -&gt; temp, IP+2 -&gt; IP, JMP (temp)\n</code></pre> <p>This, too, will cause the CPU to jump to the Code Field of DEUX. But there's one big difference: the CFA is not left in any register! So how is the machine code fragment to find the Parameter Field Address? By putting a CALL (JSR) in the Code Field instead of a JUMP. On most CPUs, the CALL instruction will push the return address -- the address immediately following the CALL instruction -- onto the Return Stack. As Figure 4 illustrates (\"case 2\"), this return address is exactly the Parameter Field Address we want! So, all DOCON has to do is pop the Return Stack -- balancing the JSR in the Code Field -- and then use that address to fetch the constant value. Thus:</p> <pre><code>DOCON:  PULS X   ; pop the PFA from the Return Stack\n        LDD ,X   ; fetch the Parameter Field cell\n        PSHU D   ; push that on the Parameter Stack\n        NEXT     ; (macro) do the next high-level word\n</code></pre> <p>Compare this with the ITC version. One instruction has been added to DOCON, but one instruction has been deleted from NEXT. DOVAR and NEXT likewise become one instruction longer:</p> <pre><code>DOVAR:  PULS X   ; pop the PFA of the word\n        PSHU X   ; push that address on the Parameter Stack\n        NEXT\n\nENTER:  PULS X   ; pop the PFA of the word\n        PSHS Y   ; push the old IP\n        TFR X,Y  ; the PFA becomes the new IP\n        NEXT\n</code></pre> <p>Now go back to the beginning of this article, and reread my \"oops,\" to see why we can't just re-fetch the CFA by using the IP.

Since this word, when executed, will define (create) a new word in the Forth dictionary, it is called a \"defining word.\" CONSTANT is one example of a defining word. All of the \"hard work\" of a defining word is done by a kernel word, CREATE, which parses a name from the input stream, builds the header and Code Field for a new word, and links it into the dictionary. (In fig-Forth this word is called \\&lt;BUILDS.) All that remains for the programmer is to build the Parameter Field.</p> <p>The answer to (b) and (c) is embodied in two convoluted words called (;CODE) and ;CODE respectively.

Everything from :\u00a0CONSTANT to ;CODE is the high-level Forth code executed when the word CONSTANT is invoked. Everything from ;CODE to END-CODE is machine code executed when the \"children\" of CONSTANT -- the \"constant-class\" words such as UN and DEUX -- are executed. That is, everything from ;CODE to END-CODE is the code fragment to which constant-type words will point. The name ;CODE signifies that it ends a high-level definition (\";\") and begins a machine- code definition (\"CODE\"). However, this is not put into the dictionary as two separate words. Everything from : CONSTANT to END-CODE is contained in the Parameter Field of CONSTANT, as shown in Figure 7.</p> <p> Figure 7. ITC ;CODE</p> <p></p> <p>Derick and Baker [DER82] name three \"sequences\" that help to understand the action of defining words:</p> <p>Sequence 1 is when the word CONSTANT is being defined. This involves both the high-level compiler (for the first part) and the Forth assembler (for the second part). This is when the definition of CONSTANT shown in Figure 7 is added to the dictionary. As we will see shortly, ;CODE -- a compiler directive -- is executed during Sequence 1.</p> <p>Sequence 2 is when the word CONSTANT is being executed, and when some constant-type word is being defined. In the example</p> <pre><code>2 CONSTANT DEUX\n</code></pre> <p>Sequence 2 is when the word CONSTANT executes, and the word DEUX is added to the dictionary (as shown in Figure 7). During Sequence 2, the high-level part of CONSTANT is executed, including the word (;CODE).</p> <p>Sequence 3 is when the constant-type word is executed. In our example, Sequence 3 is when DEUX is executed to push the value 2 onto the stack. This is when the machine-code part of CONSTANT is executed. (Recall that this fragment is the Code Field action of DEUX.)</p> <p>The words ;CODE and (;CODE) do the following:</p> <p>;CODE is executed during Sequence 1, when CONSTANT is compiled. This is an example of a Forth IMMEDIATE word -- a word executed during the Forth compilation. ;CODE does three things:</p> <p>a. it compiles the Forth word (;CODE) into CONSTANT, b. it turns off the Forth compiler, and c. it turns on the Forth assembler.</p> <p>(;CODE) is part of the word CONSTANT, so it executes when CONSTANT executes (Sequence 2). It performs the following actions:</p> <p>a. It gets the address of the machine code that immediately follows. This is done by popping IP from the Forth Return Stack.</p> <p>b. It puts that address into the Code Field of the word just defined by CREATE. The Forth word LAST (sometimes LATEST) gets the address of that word.</p> <p>c. It does the action of EXIT (a.k.a. ;S) so that the Forth inner interpreter doesn't try to execute the machine code that follows as part of the Forth thread. This is the high-level \"subroutine return\" which ends a Forth thread.</p> <p>F83 [LAX84] illustrates how these are typically coded in Forth:</p> <pre><code>: ;CODE\n    COMPILE (;CODE)     \\ compiles (;CODE) into definition\n    ?CSP  [COMPILE] [   \\ turns off the Forth compiler\n    REVEAL              \\   (just like \";\" does)\n    ASSEMBLER           \\ turns on the assembler\n    ; IMMEDIATE         \\ this is an IMMEDIATE word!\n\n: (;CODE)\n    R&gt;                  \\ pops the adrs of the machine code\n    LAST @ NAME&gt;        \\ gets the CFA of the latest word\n    !                   \\ stores the code address in the\n    ;                   \\   Code Field\n</code></pre> <p>(;CODE) is the more subtle of the two. Since it is a high-level Forth definition, the address following it in the CONSTANT thread -- the high-level \"return address\" -- is pushed onto Forth's Return Stack. So, popping the Return Stack while within (;CODE) will yield the address of the machine code that follows. Also, popping this value from the Return Stack will \"bypass\" one level of high-level subroutine return, so that when (;CODE) exits, it will exit to the caller of CONSTANT. This is equivalent to returning to CONSTANT, and then having CONSTANT return immediately.

No, because each of these machine-language fragments is just a subroutine call to a common startup routine, DODOES. (This is different from the fig-Forth DODOES routine.)

When the Forth interpreter encounters DEUX -- that is, when the Forth IP is at IP(1) -- it does the usual thing: it fetches the address contained in DEUX's Code Field, and jumps to that address. At that address is a JSR DODOES instruction, so a second jump -- this time a subroutine call -- is immediately taken. DODOES must then perform the following actions:</p> <p>a. Push the address of DEUX's Parameter Field onto the Parameter Stack, for later use by the high-level action routine.

In the early days of fig-Forth, assemblers were often the only programming tools available. This was fine for writing Forth CODE words, but high- level threads had to be written as a series of DW directives. For example, the Forth word</p> <pre><code>: MAX ( n n - n)   OVER OVER &lt; IF SWAP THEN DROP ;\n</code></pre> <p>would be written [TAL80]</p> <pre><code>      DW OVER,OVER,LESS,ZBRAN\n      DW MAX2-$\n      DW SWAP\nMAX2: DW DROP,SEMIS\n</code></pre> <p>Later, as working Forth systems became widespread, Forthwrights began modifying the Forth compilers into cross-compilers [CAS80]. Thus with Forth on your CP/M machine (or Apple II, or whatever), you could write Forth programs for some other CPU...up to and including an entirely new Forth system for that CPU.</p> <p>Because they create a new Forth from within Forth, these are often called metacompilers. Computer science purists object to this, so some Forthies use the terms \"cross-compiler\" and \"recompiler.\" The difference is that a recompiler can only generate a new Forth for the same CPU.</p> <p>Most PC Forths are now produced with metacompilers, but opinion is divided in the embedded systems arena [TIN91,ROD91,SER91]. The arguments for using assemblers to write Forth are:</p> <ol> <li>Metacompilers are cryptic and hard to understand, and you must thoroughly understand a metacompiler in order to use it.</li> <li>Assemblers are understood by the average programmer.</li> <li>An assembler is almost always available for a new CPU.</li> <li>Assemblers handle many optimizations (e.g. short vs. long branch).</li> <li>Assemblers handle forward references and peculiar address modes; many metacompilers don't.</li> <li>Assemblers use familiar editing and debugging tools.</li> <li>The code generation is completely visible -- nothing is \"hidden\" from the programmer.</li> <li>It's easier to tweak the Forth model, since many design decisions affect the internals of a metacompiler.</li> </ol> <p>The arguments for metacompilers:</p> <ol> <li>You write \"normal\" looking Forth code, which is easier to read and debug.</li> <li>Once you understand your metacompiler, you can port it easily to new CPUs.</li> <li>The only tool you need to acquire is a Forth for your computer.</li> </ol> <p>The last is particularly applicable to those who don't own PCs, since most cross-assemblers require PCs or workstations these days.</p> <p>I've written several Forths each way, so I'm painfully aware of the tradeoffs. I admit a preference for metacompilers: I find the Forth code for MAX much easier to read and understand than its assembler equivalent. Most of the arguments against metacompilers have been overcome by modern \"professional\" compilers, and if you're using Forth for work I strongly recommend investing in a commercial product. Alas, public-domain metacompilers (including my own) are still behind the times, clunky, and arcane.</p> <p>So I'm going to take a radical position for a Forth programmer, and tell you to choose for yourself. I'll publish the 6809 code in metacompiler form, and I'll supply a metacompiler for F83 (IBM PC, CP/M, or Atari ST) [ROD92]. The Z80 code will be written for a CP/M assembler. The 8051 code will be written for a public-domain PC cross-assembler.</p> <p>Forth in C?</p> <p>No discussion of this topic would be complete without mentioning a new trend: Forths written in C. These have the advantage of being more portable than assembler -- in theory, all you have to do is recompile the same source code for any CPU. The disadvantages:</p> <ol> <li>Less flexibility in the design decisions; e.g., direct-threaded code is probably not possible, and you can't optimize register assignments.</li> <li>You have to recompile the C source to add new primitives.</li> <li>Forth words carry the C call-and-return overhead.</li> <li>Some C Forths use inefficient threading techniques, e.g. a CASE statement.</li> <li>Most C compilers produce less efficient code than a good assembly-language programmer.</li> </ol> <p>But for Unix systems and RISC workstations, which frown upon assembler, this may be the only way to get a Forth up and running. The most complete and widely used of the public-domain C Forths [at the time of publication] is TILE (TILE_21.ZIP, file #2263 on GEnie's Forth Roundtable). If you're not running Unix, you should look instead at the Genie files HENCE4TH_1.2.A (#2490) and CFORTHU.ARC (#2079).</p> <p>To continue the previous comparison, here's the definition of MAX from HENCE4TH [MIS90]. I omit the dictionary headers for clarity:</p> <pre><code>_max() {\n    OVER  OVER  LESS IF  SWAP  ENDIF  DROP }\n</code></pre> <p>Instead of assembler, C is used to write the CODE words in the kernel. For example, here is HENCE4TH's SWAP:</p> <pre><code>_swap() {\n    register cell i = *(dsp);\n    *(dsp) = *(dsp + 1);\n    *(dsp + 1) = i;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>(Please note: there is quite a variety of techniques for writing Forth words in C, so these words may appear radically different in CFORTH or TILE.)</p> <p>On a 68000 or SPARC, this might produce quite good code. On a Z80 or 8051, quite the opposite. But even if you plan to write a Forth in C, you need to understand how Forth works in assembler.

As an intellectual exercise -- and to ensure a clear copyright -- I've written this code entirely from scratch. (Do you know how hard it is to not look at excellent code examples?) Of course, my experience with various Forths has no doubt influenced some design decisions.</p> <p>Due to space limitations, the source code will be presented in four installments (if you can't wait, complete files will be on GEnie):</p> <ol> <li>Z80 Forth \"primitives,\" in assembler source</li> <li>8051 Forth \"primitives,\" likewise</li> <li>Z80/8051 high-level kernel, likewise</li> <li>complete 6809 kernel, in metacompiler source</li> </ol> <p>For CamelForth I'm trying to use exclusively public-domain tools: for the Z80, the Z80MR assembler under CP/M [3]; for the 8051, the A51 cross-assembler on an IBM PC [4], and for the 6809, my own metacompiler under F83 for CP/M, IBM PC, or Atari ST.</p> <p>By \"kernel\" I mean the set of words that comprises a basic Forth system, including compiler and interpreter. For CamelForth this is the ANS Forth Core word set, plus any non-ANSI words necessary to implement the Core word set. A Forth kernel is usually written partly in machine code (as CODE words), and partly in high-level Forth. The words which are written in machine code are called the \"primitives,\" since, in the final analysis, the entire Forth system is defined in terms of just these words.</p> <p>Exactly which words should be written in machine code? The selection of the optimal set of primitives is an interesting debate. A smaller set of primitives makes for easier porting, but poorer performance. I've been told that a set of 13 primitives is sufficient to define all of Forth -- a very slow Forth. eForth [2], designed for easy porting, had a more generous set of 31 primitives. My rules are these:</p> <ol> <li>Fundamental arithmetic, logic, and memory operators are CODE.</li> <li>If a word can't be easily or efficiently written (or written at all) in terms of other Forth words, it should be CODE (e.g., U\\&lt;, RSHIFT).</li> <li>If a simple word is used frequently, CODE may be worthwhile (e.g., NIP, TUCK).</li> <li>If a word requires fewer bytes when written in CODE, do so (a rule I learned from Charles Curley).</li> <li>If the processor includes instruction support for a word's function, put it in CODE (e.g. CMOVE or SCAN on a Z80 or 8086).</li> <li>If a word juggles many parameters on the stack, but has relatively simple logic, it may be better in CODE, where the parameters can be kept in registers.</li> <li>If the logic or control flow of a word is complex, it's probably better in high-level Forth.</li> </ol> <p>For Z80 CamelForth I have a set of about 70 primitives. (See Table 1) Having already decided on the Forth model and CPU usage (see my previous TCJ articles), I followed this development procedure:</p> <ol> <li>Select the subset of the ANSI Core word set which will be primitives. (Subject to revision, of course.)</li> <li>From the ANSI descriptions, write assembler definitions of these words, plus the processor initialization code.</li> <li>Run this through the assembler, fixing source code errors.</li> <li>Test that you can produce working machine code. I usually add a few lines of assembler code to output a character once the initialization is complete. This seemingly trivial test is crucial! It ensures that your hardware, assembler, \"downloader\" (EPROM emulator or whatever), and serial communications are all working! 5. (Embedded systems only) Add another assembler code fragment to read the serial port and echo it back...thus testing both directions of communications.</li> <li>Write a high-level Forth fragment to output a character, using only Forth primitives. (Usually something like \"LIT,33h,EMIT,BYE\") This tests the Forth register initialization, the stacks, and the threading mechanism. Problems at this stage can usually be traced to logic errors in NEXT or in the initialization, or data stack goofs (e.g. stack in ROM).</li> <li>Write a colon definition to output a character, and include it in the high-level fragment from step 6. (E.g., define BLIP as \"LIT,34h,EMIT,EXIT\" and then test the fragment \"LIT,33h,EMIT, BLIP,BYE\") Problems at this stage are usually with DOCOLON or EXIT logic, or return stack goofs.</li> <li>At this point you can write some tools to help you with debugging, such as words to display in hex a number on the stack. Listing 1 shows a simple test routine to do a never-ending memory dump (useful even if your keyboard doesn't work). This tests the primitives DUP, EMIT, EXIT, C@, &gt;\\&lt;, LIT, 1+, and BRANCH, as well as several levels of nesting. Plus, it doesn't use DO..LOOP, which are often difficult to get working. When this code works, you have some confidence that your basic Forth model is valid.</li> <li>From here on it's just testing the remaining primitives -- DO..LOOP, UM/MOD, UM*, and DODOES are particularly tricky -- and adding high-level definitions. I like to get a rudimentary interpreter going next, so that I can test words interactively.</li> </ol> <p>With this set of primitives you can begin writing Forth code. Sure, you have to use an assembler instead of a Forth compiler, but -- as Listing 1 suggests -- you can use high-level control flow and nesting to write useful code that would be more difficult to write in assembler.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving5/#read-the-code","title":"READ THE CODE!","text":"<p>I've run out of abstractions for today.

For simplicity, CamelForth stores the name as a \"counted string\" (one byte of length, followed by N characters). Early Forth Inc. products stored a length but only the first three characters, for faster comparisons (the actual improvement gained is another hot debate). Fig-Forth compromised, flagging the last character with MSB high in order to allow either full-length or truncated names. Other Forths have used packed strings [4], and I suspect even C-style null-terminated strings have been used.</p> <p>The \"precedence bit\" is a flag which indicates if this word has IMMEDIATE status. IMMEDIATE words are executed even during compilation, which is how Forth implements compiler directives and control structures. There are other ways to distinguish compiler directives -- Pygmy Forth [5], for example, puts them in a separate vocabulary. But ANS Forth essentially mandates the use of a precedence bit [6]. Many Forths store this bit in the \"length\" byte. I have chosen to put it in a separate byte, in order to use the \"normal\" string operators on word names (e.g. S= within FIND, and TYPE within WORDS).</p> <p>If the names are kept in a linked list, there must be a link. Usually the latest word is at the head of the linked list, and the link points to a previous word. This enforces the ANSI (and traditional) requirement for redefined words. Charles Curley [7] has studied the placement of the link field, and found that the compiler can be made significantly faster if the link field comes before the name (rather than after, as was done in Fig-Forth).</p> <p>Figure 2 shows the structure of the CamelForth word header, and the Fig-Forth, F83, and Pygmy Forth headers for comparison. The \"view\" vield of F83 and Pygmy is an example of other useful information which can be stored in the Forth word header.</p> <p>Remember: it's important to distinguish the header from the \"body\" (executable part) of the word. They need not be stored together. The header is only used during compilation and interpretation, and a \"purely executable\" Forth application could dispense with headers entirely. However, headers must be present -- at least for the ANSI word set -- for it to be a legal ANS Forth System.</p> <p>When \"compiling\" a Forth system from assembler source code, you can define macros to build this header (see HEAD and IMMED in CAMEL80.AZM).

The value of these words becomes evident when you look at the differences between the direct-threaded Z80 and the subroutine-threaded 8051:</p> <pre><code>word     compiles on Z80   compiles on 8051\n-------- ----------------- ---------------------------\n\nCOMPILE, address           LCALL address\n!CF      CALL address      LCALL address\n,CF      !CF &amp; allot       3 bytes !CF &amp; allot 3 bytes\n!COLON   CALL docolon      nothing!\n,EXIT    address of EXIT   RET\n</code></pre> <p>(!CF and ,CF are different for indirect-threaded Forths.)</p> <p>In similar fashion, the words ,BRANCH ,DEST and !DEST hide the implementation of high-level branch and loop operators. I have tried to invent -- without borrowing from existing Forths! -- the minimal set of operators which can factor out all the implementation differences. Only time, expert criticism, and many CamelForths will tell how successful I've been.</p> <p>So far I have not been successful factoring the differences in header structure into a similar set of words. The words FIND and CREATE are so intimately involved with the header contents that I haven't yet found suitable subfactors. I have made a start, with the words NFA&gt;LFA NFA&gt;CFA IMMED? HIDE REVEAL and the ANS Forth words &gt;BODY IMMEDIATE. I'll continue to work on this. Fortunately, it is practical for the time being to use the identical header structure on all CamelForth implementations (since they're all byte-addressed 16-bit Forths).</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving6/#next-time","title":"NEXT TIME...","text":"<p>I will probably present the 8051 kernel, and talk about how the Forth compiler and interpreter are modified for Harvard architectures (computers that have logically distinct memories for Code and Data, like the 8051).

To recap: the 8051's retarded memory addressing practically demands the use of subroutine threading. This means the hardware stack (in the 8051 register file) is the Return Stack. The Parameter Stack (a.k.a. Data Stack) is in 256 bytes of external RAM, using R0 as the stack pointer. Since that article, I've discovered that it's better to keep the Top Of Stack item (TOS) in DPTR than in R3:R2. Thus:</p> reg adrs 8051 name Forth usage 0 R0 low byte of PSP (Parameter Stack Pointer) 1-5 R1-R5 scratch registers for Forth 6-7 R6-R7 loop index 8 high byte of PSP and UP (also output on P2) 9-7Fh 119 bytes of return stack (more on 8052s!) 81h SP low byte of RSP (Return Stack Pointer) 82-83h DPTR Top-Of-Stack item E0,F0h A,B scratch registers for Forth <p>This incorporates an idea from Charles Curley [CUR93]. On a register-rich machine like the 8051, we can keep the innermost loop index in registers. This makes LOOP and +LOOP much faster. DO must still push two values on the Return Stack: the old loop index, and the new loop limit! UNLOOP must of course restore the loop index from the Return Stack -- kudos to the ANSI team for making UNLOOP a distinct word! Note that R6:R7 are not the topmost Return Stack item, merely the innermost loop index.</p> <p>Port 2 (P2) contains the high byte of the Parameter Stack Pointer (allowing R0 to address external memory), which is also the high byte of the User Pointer -- the low byte of UP is assumed to be 00. I learned the hard way that P2 can't be read while executing from external ROM, so I keep a copy of the P2 byte in register 8.</p> <p>I have a novel implementation of BRANCH and ?BRANCH. Since the 8051 model is subroutine-threaded, high-level Forth is compiled as true machine code. So BRANCH can be implemented with an SJMP (or AJMP or LJMP) instruction. ?BRANCH can be implemented with a JZ instruction, if the zero/nonzero status of the top-of-stack is put in the accumulator (A register). The subroutine ZEROSENSE does this. So, BRANCH and ?BRANCH become</p> <pre><code>BRANCH:   SJMP dest \n?BRANCH:  LCALL ZEROSENSE JZ dest\n</code></pre> <p>Similar routines LOOPSENSE and PLUSLOOPSENSE allow a JZ instruction to be used for LOOP and +LOOP. For these, a call to UNLOOP must appear after the JZ, to clean up the Return Stack when the program \"falls out\" of the loop.</p> <p>In the assembly language source file I have manually replaced the sequence</p> <pre><code>LCALL word   RET\n</code></pre> <p>with the shorter and faster</p> <pre><code>LJMP word\n</code></pre> <p>in many places [CUR93]. This works as long as \"word\" isn't a return-stack operator (such as R&gt; or &gt;R). LCALL and LJMP have also been replaced with ACALL and AJMP where possible. The CamelForth compiler does not attempt these optimizations.</p> <p>I wrote the 8051 kernel to use \"Intel\" byte order (low byte first). Then I discovered that the address compiled into an LJMP or LCALL is stored high byte first. Rather than rewrite the entire kernel, I included a byte-swap in those words which compile LCALLs: COMPILE, !CF and ,CF (all in the Dependency word set).</p> <p>Listing 1 gives the 8051 assembly language \"primitives\", and Listing 2 gives the Dependency word set.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving7/#harvard-architectures","title":"HARVARD ARCHITECTURES","text":"<p>The 8051 uses a \"Harvard\" architecture: program and data are kept in separate memories. In embedded systems, these are typically ROM and RAM, respectively. ANS Forth is the first Forth standard to address the restrictions of a Harvard architecture. Briefly, ANS Forth says that a) application programs can only access Data memory, and b) all of the operators used to access memory and build data structures must operate in Data space. (Ref. section 3.3.3 of the ANS document [ANS94].) This includes the Forth words</p> <p>@ ! C@ C! DP HERE ALLOT , C, COUNT TYPE WORD (S\") S\" CMOVE</p> <p>Yet the Forth compiler still needs to access Program space (also called Code or Instruction space). And Forth needs to maintain a dictionary pointer for Program space as well as Data space. So I've added these new words (shown in Listing 3):</p> <p>I@ I! IC@ IC! IDP IHERE IALLOT I, IC, ICOUNT ITYPE IWORD (IS\") IS\" D-&gt;I I-&gt;D</p> <p>The \"I\" prefix stands for \"Instruction\" (since \"P\" and \"C\" have other meanings in Forth). ICOUNT and ITYPE are needed to display strings which have been compiled into ROM. IWORD copies the string left by WORD from Data space to Code space -- needed to build Forth word headers and ROMmed strings. D-&gt;I and I-&gt;D are equivalents of CMOVE, which copy to and from Code space.</p> <p>VARIABLEs must have addresses in Data space. So they can't use the traditional practice of putting the data immediately after the Code field. Instead, the Data space address of the data is stored after the Code field. In essence, a VARIABLE is a CONSTANT whose value is the Data space address. (Note that the traditional CONSTANT is still valid.)</p> <p>CREATEd words, and words built with CREATE...DOES&gt;, must work the same way. Here's how they look in Program space:</p> <pre><code>CODE word:   ...header... 8051 machine code \nhigh-level:  ...header... 8051 machine code \nCONSTANT:    ...header... LCALL-DOCON  value \nVARIABLE:    ...header... LCALL-DOCON  Data-adrs \nCREATEd:     ...header... LCALL-DOCON  Data-adrs\n</code></pre> <p>Note that CONSTANT must replace the value stored by CREATE, and : must \"un-allot\" both this value and the LCALL DOCON.</p> <p>S\" presents special problems. Strings defined with S\" (\"text literals\") must reside in Data space, where they can be used by such words as TYPE and EVALUATE. But we expect those strings to be part of a definition, and to exist in ROM in a ROM forth environment. We could store the string in Program space, and copy it to HERE when referenced, but the ANS document does not allow text literals to exist in this \"transient\" storage region (ref. sections 3.3.3.4 and 3.3.3.6 [ANS93]). Also, if WORD returns its string at HERE -- as in CamelForth -- text literals must not alter this transient region.</p> <p>My solution is to have S\" store the string in Code space, but permanently reserve space for it in Data space, and copy it from Code to Data when referenced. ANS Forth does not yet fully address the problems of Harvard processors; something like C's \"initialized data\" region may eventually be required.</p> <p>Since .\" strings can never be accessed by the programmer, they can be stored in Code space, using the words (IS\") and IS\". (These are the \"old\" (S\") and S\".) This adds two words to the kernel, but saves quite a bit of Data space. I plan to move the string-literal words into either the Dependency word set, or a new \"Harvard\" word set.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving7/#writing-to-program-space","title":"WRITING TO PROGRAM SPACE","text":"<p>The 8051 can't actually write to Program memory.

Right away you'll notice two things: first, the metacompiler runs on an older Forth (F83), and so the source code is contained in 16x64 Forth \"screens\". I've converted these to an ASCII file for TCJ, but the original formatting is still evident.</p> <p>Second, source code for a Forth metacompiler looks like ordinary Forth code (with a few changes, which I'll discuss shortly). Thus the definition of <code>1+</code> is given as</p> <pre><code>CODE 1+   1 # ADDD,   NEXT   ;C\n</code></pre> <p>The assembler used is the 6809 assembler I've described previously in TCJ [ROD91].</p> <p>I typed the high-level source code directly from the already-published listings (converting to the Forth syntax in the process). Unfortunately, this was done over the space of a few days, and sometimes I worked from the Z80 listing, and sometimes the 8051... with the result that the Harvard-architecture constructs (such as I@ and IALLOT) are not consistently used in the 6809 code. This is of no consequence for the non-Harvard 6809, but I'll have to correct this before porting the Forth code to a Harvard CPU.</p> <p>Also, since I was working from published listings, I often neglected typing the detailed comments for the high-level words. For this I apologize. You can find how any word works by consulting the previous listings, but I shouldn't force you to do this.</p> <p>6809 CAMELFORTH SOURCE CODE</p> <p>The 6809 CamelForth model holds top-of-stack in D, and uses the S stack pointer for the Parameter Stack. The U stack pointer is the Return Stack Pointer, and Y is the Interpreter Pointer. X is the temporary register \"W\". The 6809 direct page pointer DPR holds the high byte of the User Pointer (the low byte is assumed to be zero).</p> <p>The memory map for a Scroungemaster II with 8K of RAM and 8K of EPROM is as follows:</p> <pre><code>6000-797Fh RAM dictionary (for new definitions)\n7980-79FFh Terminal Input Buffer\n7A00-7A7Fh User Area (USER variables)\n7A80-7AFFh Parameter Stack (grows downward)\n7B00-7B27h HOLD area (grows downward) \n7B28-7B7Fh PAD area (general purpose buffer)\n7B80-7BFFh Return Stack (grows downward)\n\nE000-FFFFh Forth kernel in EPROM\n</code></pre> <p>All of the RAM data areas are referenced to the User Pointer, whose starting value is given by UP-INIT: in this case, 7A00h. (Note the use of UP-INIT-HI for the high byte of this value) When CamelForth starts, it will set its Dictionary Pointer to DP-INIT, which must be in RAM so you can add new definitions to the Forth dictionary. These are all specified with the metacompiler's EQU directive. An EQU is like a CONSTANT, except that it is only known to the metacompiler. These EQUates take up no space in the 6809 kernel, and will not appear in the 6809 Forth's dictionary.</p> <p>DICTIONARY tells the metacompiler where to compile the code, in this case for an 8K EPROM from E000-FFFFh. The new dictionary is named \"ROM\", and then ROM is specified to select that dictionary. (If you're familiar with Forth vocabularies, you'll see a strong resemblance.)</p> <p>AKA (\"also known as\") defines a synonym for a Forth word. Since the 6809 is a non-Harvard machine, we should compile @ wherever I@ appears in the source code, and likewise for the other \"I-prefix\" (instruction-space) words. AKA will do this. These synonyms are like EQUates -- they don't appear in the 6809 dictionary.</p> <p>The metacompiler allows you to use forward references, i.e., Forth words which haven't been defined yet. (You must of course define them before you finish!) Often this is automatic, but AKA requires you to explicitly declare a forward reference with PRESUME. Thus</p> <pre><code>PRESUME WORD   AKA WORD IWORD\n</code></pre> <p>is needed to create the IWORD synonym. @ ! HERE ALLOT and the others are PRESUMEd by the metacompiler, so we don't have to do so here.</p> <p>The CODE definitions are conventional. Note that you can use</p> <pre><code>HERE EQU labelname\n</code></pre> <p>to generate a label when metacompiling. (This is a function of the metacompiler, not the assembler) Also, ASM: begins a \"fragment\" of assembler code (i.e., not part of a CODE word).</p> <p>The phrase</p> <pre><code>HERE RESOLVES name\n</code></pre> <p>is used to resolve certain forward references which are made by the metacompiler (for example, the metacompiler has to know where the code for the DOCOLON action is). You should leave these alone. Otherwise, feel free to add any CODE definitions to the source code.</p> <p>The code for defining words and control structures (IMMEDIATE words) is rather opaque. This is because these words must also perform some action while metacompiling. For example: the 6809 Forth includes the standard word CONSTANT, to define new constants. But CONSTANTs may also appear in the 6809 kernel; we may have to define a CONSTANT while metacompiling. The EMULATE: phrase instructs the metacompiler how to handle the word CONSTANT if it is encountered. This phrase is written entirely using metacompiler words, and so may appear to be total gibberish.</p> <p>Likewise, IF THEN and their ilk include the metacompiler phrases to build and resolve branches in the 6809 image. Some Forth metacompilers bury this code inside the compiler. This makes for prettier target code, but if you change the way branches work (for example), you have to perform surgery on the metacompiler. I preferred to make these actions easily changeable, and so I designed Chromium to put them in the target source code. (The most horrific examples are the definitions of TENDLOOP and TS\", which actually extend the metacompiler vocabulary in the middle of the target source code.)</p> <p>If you're new to Forth and the metacompiler, it's best to just accept these as given. \"Ordinary\" colon definitions are easy to add. Just follow the example of the rest of the 6809 source code. You can even make CREATE..DOES&gt; definitions, as long as you don't need to use them within the metacompiler.</p>"},{"location":"Moving_Forth/moving8/#future-work","title":"FUTURE WORK","text":"<p>On a 1 MHz 6809, a line of text input takes a noticeable time to process (up to 1 second at a rough estimate). This is partly becuase so much of the interpreter is written in high-level Forth, and partly because CamelForth uses a single-linked-list dictionary. These handicaps only affect compilation speed, not execution speed, but the delays can be annoying. Maybe someday I'll do an article on \"Accelerating Forth\".</p> <p>Currently, the User Pointer never changes. The reason we have a User Pointer is to support multitasking -- each task having separate user area, stacks, etc. I'll be working on this soon. I may also explore using the SM II's memory management to give each task a full 32K private dictionary. And of course, I intend to write a true multiprocessor Forth kernel using the shared bus. If I live long enough, a distributed Forth kernel using the serial ports (a la Transputer) is the logical next step.</p> <p>The source code for 6809 CamelForth, version 1.0, is available on GEnie's Forth Roundtable in the file CAM09-10.ZIP.

Then you merely type</p> <pre><code>F83 CHROMIUM.SCR\n1 LOAD\nBYE\n</code></pre> <p>This will load the metacompiler, compile the 6809 CamelForth, and write the result to an Intel hex file 6809.HEX. Note: if you're using the CP/M or Atari ST versions of F83, you'll have to edit the load screen to delete the hex file utility, since this only works under MS- DOS.
