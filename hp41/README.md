# HP-41

The 1979 HP-41 series programmable calculator, which was produced until 1990, and was used in the Shuttle Space missions, has a processor called "Coconut" (or 1LE3 CPU), RAM, ROM, I/O, and uses the interpreted programming language FOCAL ("Forty One Calculator Language"). The operating system and the interpreter are stored in ROM, and were programmed using the Coconut processor assembly language also called MCODE (or "M-Code").
