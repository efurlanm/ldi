# Language Design and Implementation

My personal notes on Language Design and Implementation, and related topics.

Website: <https://efurlanm.github.io/ldi/>

All sources, including Jupyter Notebooks, are in the [docs-src](docs-src) directory.

This repository contains the sources for the documentation that is made using the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) static site and documentation generator. It uses the `docs-scr` directory with the sources to generate the HTML pages, which are stored in the `docs` directory. The HTML pages are served by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and made available online on the web.
