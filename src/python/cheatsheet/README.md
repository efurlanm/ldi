# Python Cheat Sheet

*Last edited: 2024-11-27*

*Python â€“ Cheat Sheet*, by Valdemar W. Setzer [[Source, in Portuguese](https://www.ime.usp.br/~vwsetzer/python-opers-funcoes.html)] - this directory contains my attempt to help build the cheat sheet by describing some functions and modules that are not yet in the sheet. It is a work in progress and subject to constant change.

## Current work

* [Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1plg9g5vMVei8Xr-B9jydi2FfOlteiRP8VpnO0_t481Q/edit?usp=sharing) (in English, Google Docs format) - document converted to English using Google Translate, and edited manually. Include suggestions. Corrections are highlighted in yellow, suggestions are highlighted in red, and the old text is highlighted in gray.

### Comments

- Use Python 3 links like: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp>. In the text there are links that point to version 2.
